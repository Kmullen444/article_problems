[Search in Rotated Array](https://github.com/Kmullen444/article_problems/tree/main/search_rotated)

In our newest article we build on the code from our last post [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://github.com/Kmullen444/article_problems/tree/main/min_rotated)
where we binary searched through a sorted array that has been rotated **n** number of times.
This time we are given a sorted array that is rotated **n** number of times and a 
target number we are looking for. Making this much closer to the traditional 
binary search. Come build your fondation of knowledge and check out this article.

[Max Product of Subarray](https://github.com/Kmullen444/article_problems/tree/main/max_pro_subarray)

This is part of our current series, where we are working through the curated list
that was posted on [TeamBlind.com](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU).
In this article we are working through an array while looking for the maximum product
of a subarray. This was a lot of fun to work on and show how we are building a 
solid fondation.

Be sure to check out the rest of our articles and return soon for another post.
