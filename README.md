[Find minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://github.com/Kmullen444/article_problems/tree/main/min_rotated)

Continuing on our series where we are working through the list of interview
question that can be found at [TeamBlind.com](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU).
We take a quick aside to talk about how a binary search works and use that 
concept to search through a sorted array that has been rotated an n number of times
for the minimum value. This is definitely a fun one to work through and is our 
first use of a defined algorithm.

[Max Product of Subarray](https://github.com/Kmullen444/article_problems/tree/main/max_pro_subarray)

This is part of our current series, where we are working through the curated list
that was posted on [TeamBlind.com](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU).
In this article we are working through an array while looking for the maximum product
of a subarray. This was a lot of fun to work on and show how we are building a 
solid fondation.

Be sure to check out the rest of our articles and return soon for another post.
