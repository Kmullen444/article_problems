[3Sum](https://github.com/Kmullen444/article_problems/tree/main/three_sum)

In this article we build on the ideas from our [Two Sum II](https://github.com/Kmullen444/article_problems/tree/main/two_sum_two)
where we use two points added together to try and find a given target number. 
With 3Sum we are looking for 3 points that when added together equal 0. We are 
getting to the end of the array section of the list we are working that you can 
find [here](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU).

In this article we are working through an array while looking for the maximum product
of a subarray. This was a lot of fun to work on and show how we are building a 
solid fondation.
